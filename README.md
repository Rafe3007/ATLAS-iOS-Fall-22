# ATLS-MobileAppDev

App Idea:
- A game about baking bread which hopefully teaches the user real facts and techniques about the bread
- Similar to a sushi go 'round game
  - You will receive visual instruction as to how you will make the bread
  - You will combine the ingredients by simply tapping the ingredients
  - Repeat the cycle for the next orders
  
 Future additions:
 - Add Proofing mechanics to help teach people how to proof and/or to ferment
